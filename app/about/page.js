      <p style={{ marginTop: "20px", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
        Electrical and Embedded Systems Engineer with experience delivering hardware
        and energy systems from requirements definition through deployment.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "20px", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
        I focus on structured execution — translating stakeholder requirements into
        deployable technical architectures, coordinating cross-functional teams,
        and validating performance against defined acceptance criteria.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "20px", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
        I enjoy building systems that work in the real world — not just in theory.
